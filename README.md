# Photopigment concentration calculator from photospectrometric data
This code is my first application I made and used for my thesis.

1. Extract photopigemnts using methanol-based method.

2. From the absorption values, the pigment concentrations can be calculated the following:
> Chlorophyll a [μg/ml] = 12.9447 (A665 − A720) (Ritchie, 2006)

> Carotenoids [μg/ml] = [1,000 (A470 − A720) − 2.86 (Chla [μg/ml])] / 221 (Wellburn, 1994)

3. Enter OD on which you want to normalize to get [μg/ml/OD]
